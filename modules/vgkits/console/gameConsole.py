        Hosts a game, showing output and receiving input through the text console.

        It accepts a gameMaker function. This should be a generator function (a
        function which uses the yield keyword).

        The generator function will be called passing a `show` function as a parameter.

        Within gameMaker, show() can be called to make lines of text appear for the user.

        A question prompting the user can be passed at any point in the game sequence with a
        yield expression. The value of the yield expression will be what the user typed
        in response to the text prompt.

        For example this would define a simple game which will run forever...
