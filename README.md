Reference configuration for a [Vanguard board](https://vgkits.org/blog/projects/vanguard/)

If you have a pre-configured board [sourced from @vgkits](https://vgkits.co.uk), see the [Demo video](https://vgkits.org/blog/2018/05/08/introductory-video-tutorial/), [Vanguard Rainbow project page](https://vgkits.org/blog/projects/rainbow/), [programming introduction](https://vgkits.org/blog/hellorainbow/) or the [Tutorial PDF](https://vgkits.co.uk/rainbow/tutorial.pdf) 

If you have sourced a factory-configured NodeMCU-M from a wholesaler, and have python3 installed properly, attach it with high-quality USB cable, change into the `utilities` folder and run...

```
python3 getlibs.py
python3 deployall.py
```

...to configure it as a Vanguard board.
